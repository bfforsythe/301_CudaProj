### CS301 CUDA / OpenCV project.

©️ Brandon Forsythe, 2022.


This project aims to experiment with the use of CUDA as a compliment to OpenCV. 
Using the images provided (Greg and derivatives), the programs inside allow the changing of RGB channels in order to manipulate colors, gradients, or otherwise.

This project requires CUDA hardware (or CUDA libraries installed on host computer) as well as the CUDA Toolkit (Nvida NSight).

All files and inherited classes are separated into two folders, <b> CUDA </b> and <b> NONCuda </b> which can be used to time and compare the differences between the two.
